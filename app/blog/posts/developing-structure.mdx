title: 'Developing a Structure'
publishedAt: '2024-05-20'
summary: 'I try to develop some structure in my life to make my thoughts less scattered'
---
Sometimes I, in an almost moment of brilliance, come up with ideas that for me seem awesome and cool and these ideas can encompass my
thoughts for what feels like days at a time. In these days as I walk around at work, cook food, read articles,literally do anything my mind 
is stuck on these ideas. I feel like I make progress on the idea and I keep building upon it, until, I move on. My mind moves on to something else
and now all that mental energy has gone to waste as I've let these ideas that I wanted to make come to life slip through the cracks.

So how do I fix this. I need to write these ideas down and I need to keep them together. I need a list of things that I need to do
so that when boredom hits, I have something to work on immediately. I need structure.


## To-Do List

1. This website

    I figure it would probably be a good idea since my new sense of discipline and stream of motivation has led me to finally putting together
    a portfolio site, I should finish this so that it doesn't become one of those projects that sits there half-working and half-finished.

    Of course, the site will never truly be done, there will always be stuff I would like to add to it.
    - &#x2610; Chess Tracker
    - &#x2610; Make it more personal
        - I'd like to add a little dice roller like from Baldur's Gate 
    - &#x2610; Add more room in the nav 
    - &#x2610; Finances Guide
2. Europa Universalis 4 App

    For the most part I would consider this to be mostly finished, but now there are some
    aspects that need to be adressed now that the core functionality is done
    - Lack of clarity regarding sent requests (Loading Bar)
    - Bug when using search bar, sometimes the requests go through, sometimes it appears like they don't
    - Animations? Site feels clunky

3. r/NYY Sentiment Analysis

    This project is still really new, haven't really done much but the frontend
    - Build Classifier to attach subject of comment
    - Analyze sentiment of threads
    - Scraper to get roster (40 Man or current 26 plus prospects)
    - Add chart to track each individual players sentiment score alongside winrate graph
        - Maybe add in for each day how the player performed to see if the performance warrants the sentiment
    - Add Cards to track the current highest and lowest sentiment scoring players, and maybe highest uptick or downtick in score

4. KnowYourPolitician Map

    Still brainstorming ideas
    - Overhead view of U.S Map, shows the current house and senate splits
    - Toggle between Senate and House Mode
        - House Mode can show the districts overlayed on the Map
            -When clicked each district will pop up a card that shows the Politician, their party, Educational background, election year,
            when they are up for reelection, Use a LLM to create a small abstract regarding that person's platform and positiions
            - Add color to display what party controls the seat
    - When clicked on each state list some important information, like electoral votes?

5. Homelab

    There's alot of things I would like to start with the homelab...
    - Minecraft server
    - PfSense VM
    - Plex
    - AdGuard / PiHole
    -
    
    This should probably be higher on the list to be honest, just purely based on how long I've put this off.
    
6. Whimsy40

    It's been like a year, build the keyboard already
